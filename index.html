		<h2>About Batman</h2>
		<p>Batman is a vigilante hero that works in the night to breathe fear into the local goons and gangsters of Gotham City. The GCPD does not condone his actions, however he is known to work with them frequently to solve cases that are beyond their capabilities whether that be tracking down a serial killer who kills on holidays or capturing a clown.</p>
